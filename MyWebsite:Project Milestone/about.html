        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>
          I’m currently studying at KSU, majoring in Information Technology. My
          journey started with a curiosity about how websites and apps work.
          Over time, this curiosity transformed into a passion for creating and
          learning about technology.
        </p>
        <p>
          During my time at KSU, I’ve worked on various projects, from building
          websites to developing small applications. These experiences have
          honed my skills in front-end and back-end development, particularly
          with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Node.js.
        </p>
        <p>
          Looking ahead, I’m excited to apply my skills in real-world scenarios,
          contribute to innovative projects, and continue learning as the tech
          field evolves.
